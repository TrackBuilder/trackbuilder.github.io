    [Tue 10/3: 5hr][1hr today]I have been super lazy in procrastinate lately. I was a bit burn out after the demo, so I though I could take a day off or two. Today: update the website.
    And then the Corona came and then there is the whole work place shut-down and then I have to set up some remote work.
    And I was mostly looking for a car to buy so we can avoid public transport during this pandemic time, ofcourse we try to stay home as much as possible, but sometimes, you have to go out.
    But yeah, it was mostly procrastination as most night, I was just watching films with my wif. We finished the first season of Sex Education on Netflix, it was briliant, play a lot of Slay the spire, and like 2 or 3 nights just seeing old cars.
    Hopefully, this update will be the back to action. I will try to focus on the game tomorrow.
    The last week Tuesday demo went well. I had like 10 players played the game and I received a lot of notes and feedback. There was 2 guys who was genuelly enjoy the game and once they get the gasp, they played for quite a while and enjoy themselves quite a lot. So I guess I have something. Still lots of work to be done though, but it's great. I will probably need another update for all the updates I gathered.
    Also, update, by now, I have 25 wishlists, after one and a half week on Steam, which is a bit too little. I guess the game is too early so not a lot of people interested in it, just yet. Let's see the update after a month, more graphic and stuffs.

    [4hr]Add tons of duct tape so that the game is playable. Containing: buy menu, rework food container, 2 players mode and tons of duct tape.
    Buy Menu: You can buy stuffs from the computer. You can also start game using that game menu as well. Using money, gain from serving customer.

Let's hope that this time I didn't fuck up and I will finally have a steam page for the demo day.                                                                                                                                                              commit 90163754c618f7bc9f25ab024c7253c61cf112c6                                                                         Author: Minh Duc <minhduc.gameregistry@gmail.com>                                                                       Date:   Sun Mar 8 23:58:54 2020 +0200                                                                                                                                                                                                               [2hr]Start working on the computer to buy sell stuffs. The computer works at the basic level as I press it, and it will show a buy menu, but there's nothing yet. Will need to design and balance it. But now, I will head to prepare the steam page.

    [3hr]Start menu and restart game function seems to work. Next to working on the Computer to have a SELL/BUY menu and a true start game function.
    Also, redesign all the map that they are more fun/interesting, (objectively, in my opinion).
    Temporaly make the camera fixed in the middle of the map, instead of following the player.
    Happy International Woman's day <3

    [2hr]The place object on top-left function works. Now, I will work on the main menu (maybe not needed), but definitely a restart function. And a buy menu. After that, the game is presentable/playable? Maybe?

    [1.5hr]The map loading menu works. I also finally got a really nice looking logo from the guy on Fiverr, which, I'm quite satisfied.
    Map loading works unloading old map and loading new map. Also retain the position of all objects on board. Still needs the automated position finding for object placed on non-ground tile but I guess I will work with that tomorrow.
    Add a start menu scene, so I will try to make a start-menu next (tomorrow), so I can test the Restart function of the game properly.

    [1hr]Remove the place-holder unity editor fields in the grid-manager to store the sprite data of each gridtype. They are now store properly inside a json file name GridTileData.json
    Spend most of the time wondering why my json file also return an exception when tried to load. It turn out that your json file, while being read by the C# Serialier can not have extra comma \,\. For example, this is perfectly fine in js, or even typescript
    {"a":"a-field", "b":"b-field",} -> The extra comma after "b" field is completely fine in js or ts (or even Python, I think), but will fuck up either the C# serializer or UnityJson parser real hard.

    [1hr]Add 2 new maps (floor plan/maybe) so we have 3 maps total now. It's not needed, just fun thing to do. Add some ground works so that the loading of the map will be handle better.
    Just watch the Oscar winning movie Parasite, it's good, I like it, genre mixing film with some underlying views of the system, nice movie.

    [2hr-Working on the logo on Fiverr]-[1.5hr]Redraw the recycle bin sprite, it looks slightly better. Add a computer sprite, in which the customer can use to buy stuffs, like food/funiture to their kitchen.
    Also, the guy from Fiverr already delivered his works. It looks lovely, now I really do regret that I didn't pay extra 10 dollar to have access to his source file. I asked some small revision (his logo looks like a noodle bowl, instead of Pho Bowl), and ask if I could pay extra to buy access to his source vector file.

    [1hr]Add a quick fix to the Game Grid so that we can not place object on top of it anymore.
    Next, will try to make a function that spawned object, if placed on a wall, will try to place it on the top left corner of the screen or some where similar.

    [3hr]The UI Save/Load Layout is now functioning with 3 slots. Will make so that the map-load works properly next.
    Try to solve the button selection bug but couldn't do it. I am thinking I should make it so that if nothing is selected, and a controller button is detected, it will automatically select a top UI button.

    [3hr]A lot of struggling with the UI codes and now Doozy and Rewire finally works together for now, but it's quite a bit buggy for me.

    How to make Doozy works with Rewire: This is quite a band-aid fix to the problem. Because I'm using 2 plug-ins that doesn't intended to work with each other: DoozyUI and Rewire. As far as I understand, the DoozyUI only allow "onClick" function to be, a mouse click or a touch/tap. Thus, button pressed using controller, will not be recognized by DoozyUI Button. That's because Rewire UI register to the EventManager, sub component of Unity UI, while DoozyUI handle button pressed on it owns, thus, ignore the Unity Event system (I think). Thus, the fix is really simple and band-aid. If the button register an on-click event, execute the Doozy Click function. This can be troublesome, as the ExecuteClick will be call twice if we click the button with the mouse, but I don't see any problem, so probably there are some under-the-hood code that check for duplication. Also, note here just for future reference because having an additional Component to every button is annoying. I just go straight into the DoozyButton code and register this listener myself. In their OnEnable and OnDisable fucntion. Also, quite funny that somehow after adding this "fix" the [B] button suddenly works as a back button.

    Another bug with selection: There is this huge problem with the UI is that if the user CLICK the mouse outside of the Menu Area, all button will get deselected, thus, make us un-focus on the menu, thus, make it impossible to control the UI with the controller anymore! Need fix!
    Also, there is this brief bug of if you are scrolling around the PauseViewMapLayout, if you press BACK while moving the cursor, the menu WILL lose selection base, and the only way to get out of that is to exit the whole state.

    Mom have left this afternoon, go back to Vietnam, not live with me and my wife anymore. While it was sometimes irritating living with her in our relatively small apartment, now that she's gone, I do miss her.

    [1hr]The pause menu works now. There is a nice NULL reference bug, going right after another pause logic bug of mine, that make the game fully functional, but I should fix both of them.
    Like it's interesting, 2 wrongs make an smooth game. But I should fix it.
    Also, got a new used apple watch series 3, so I'm just messing with it. Seem fun.

    [2hr]Successfully import DoozyUI into the game. Doozy UI works as well as it's expected, but I still have a lot of questions.
    Like I'm not sure the proper way to have a pause menu and then enter it at the press of a button. Like, hmm, how ... I'm doing work around and I feel like it's totally wrong.
    The importing error is also weird, they have one error line, and if I remove that, it will install normally. But it didn't happen with my test project, which is like, err?

    [15mins]Add proper PC keyboard map to the game, so that PC also have equivalent of Y and B button now. (V for [Y] and B for [B])
    I though there is some bug caused by the recent map loader change that make picking up object buggy, turn out problem is that I was charging my mouse, which make my xbox controller un-plugged, so I had to use my keyboard, which make me realize that my keyboard mapping is incompleted.

    [4h]Trying to learn DoozyUI again after I realize that I will waste a lot of useless time at the menu stuffs.
    I think I learn enough of Doozy UI to use now, it's a really amazing asset, the only problem now is that I just can't import it to the current project, which is a huge annoyance. Anyway, update DoTween because I though it would help (but it didn't). Commit to save the upgraded DoTween version, will try more.

    [1hr]More working with the Save load ui. Mostly just experiment with Button.onClick.AddListener(function with param).
    Encounter a really weird issue, where I can't use the i index of the loop directly, if I do so, all the function will be called with the max index. Which is weird.
    Here is the problem I'm talking about

    for (int i =0; i < buttonNums; i ++) {
       buttonNums[i].onClick.AddListener(() => { myFunction(i)});
    }

    If I use this, all the button, on click, will call myFunction(buttonNums), not myFunction(0/1/2) as I would like to, so I have to make a

    int index = i, and use that index value. Which is weird .....

    Also, UI is quite complicated, so I might looking into reinstall Doozy UI again if it save some times.

    [30min]Start working on a save/load layout menu so that we can have multiple save layout as well as save slots. Let's go with 3 for now.
    Tried to do more, but ended up getting in the rabid hole of youtube. I have been playing Hitman 2 recently, Hitman Blood money still is one of my favorite video game so I really like hitman 2016. Haven't actually play the new map in the hitman 2, just played all the map from the first game, but ported to the second game, and I love every one of it so far. Kind of rush through each level and only run once, no replay, but still really nice game to play.

    [1.5hr]Map a map editor/map loader of sort. It works, but needs a lot of bug fix.
    The map is just a text file of x * y dimension, with proper error handling of course, with text making each type, for example, w is WALL, k is KITCHEN. It works now, but I think lots of extra work with the GridManager. Mostly because coordination is a difficult stuff, and I don't want to change already working code too much.
    Example of a map:
    wwwwwwwwwwwww
    wyyykkkkkkkkw
    wyyykkkkkkkkw
    wyyykkkkkkkkw

    Learning the tool mmfpeg, really nice command line tool for making gif, but there are a lot of annoying display artifact, which make the gif look a bit noisy. Also, try installing ubuntu and linux for window, because the bash script I need to run the file is a .sh file, but well, it doesn't work. So ...

    [5hr]Work my ass off to update the websites, update the git commit, generate game play clip.

    The game play clip was created using Davinci Resolve, which is a really decent free video editor software. Really nice, some small hurdle at first, but it works out nicely.

    I didn't even have time to create some gif and graphics, just a screen shot of the game and the teaser trailer. But I guess it's nice I guess. Maybe I should try to setup the steam page soon.

    The commit on this project is just a spiritual one because all I did was remove one line. Most of the works were done somewhere else, but I want to log it here anyway, because I want this git-log to be the main source of dev-documents.

Game look quite good (lol) now, so tomorrow, I will mostly just generate the materials for the websites and generate a video.

    [4hr]Had a really productive day. Make chopping board locking (automatically chop and lock player in one place) again, spend 1 hr trying to fix a stupid bug related to that. Re-adjust the timer for cooking/waiting/chopping but it still doesn't feel right, yet. Add kitchen tile, wall tile and floor tile to the map. It looks functional, but it's quite ugly now. Also re-adjust the tutorial button panel a bit but still really ugly and out of place.
    Spend most of the afternoon play Slay the Spire, so I pass like from ascension 1 to 4, but then I have a huge headache (probably from the stress from playing that game), so I went to sleep at like 4 and wake up at 7h30. Wife also made an awesome matcha-cheese cake, which is awesome.

But, well, it's not for now. Also, add a shitty done version of the tutorial panel, where I display the basic instruction of the game. It's bad.

Add a quick hack button (press both triggers) to speed up the time (x3). Add a game timer UI to keep track of the time. Needs more works and refactoring though.
    Also, took the dog to another vets hospital today to check her eyes issue. She got infected something and they give some medicine, but it costs us 169 euro, damn.

    [1.5hr]FInish with the text popup animation. It's popup and fade out nicely now. Took a bit longer than I though because of a stupid bug regarding the Game interface. It's really late in the evening now so I have to go to sleep.
    The reason for the change in the GameInterface UI is that, the animation there is counting up, from 0 to ANIM DURATION, but in the code, I want every timer to count from value, to 0. For consistency sake, so I rework that, and silly me, forgot some place thus, make it not working. Also help that yesterday I did a small refactor to that part, so it didn't work properly since yesterday ....

    [1hr]Finish with the clock icon and danger icon for now. Also, add a very basic pausing functionality, which means, time stop (well, run at a 0.0001 rate) when ui is on.
    The clock icon will animate faster when the countdown is closing to end. These code is a bit dirty and un-clean, but these code will be changed later anyway, so no need for clean code, just yet. Also, there was a weird bug yesterday where somehow after the first time its appear, the clock animation will appear BEHIND the progress bar, even though there is nothing wrong. Somehow, this bug doesn't happen today, which make no sense.

    [2hr]Moving some asset files around a bit so it's a bit more organized. Create a clocking icon/animation to show all the timer task and a warning icon to so emergency timer. It's work in progress. Kind of works, but there is some bug and refactor needed.
    Today, I played Overcooked 2 with my wife, it was pretty fun and challenging, which is perfect game, as I have tried some other coop game, such as Tools up, a overcooked like game but for moving house, which is okei, too easy, so we got bored after a while, and the main reason is that there is not much variant between rounds I guess. And Unrailed, which we also dislike, but because the game is too stressful, taxxing. Not super hard, but really stressful, which isn't nice.    Also, the dog got like health issue, like last week (last Sunday) I was playing with her and throw the floor ball into her face (we were playing catching), it looks fine at first, but then I think because she kept scratching her eye, it got some serious infection, so it got quite bad. We have put the collar of shame to her and wipe her eyes every few hours, but it got tired really fast because the dog kept waking us up mid night because her eye was really itchy, so we have to wipe her face for her. 4/10, not recommended, but an experience, nonetheless.

    [1.5hr]Add a countdown mechanic for the dining table and the progress bar. It looks alright now, but I think I need to add sound to the game later, because it's kind of not feeling kind of bad now.
    Good sound is needed I guess. But good new is the progress bar and the count down for the dining table works. I was planning to to it for the cooking pot as well, but it's a bit more difficult so it will be later.
    Add a 2x2 pixel white box for all the progress-bar and pure color sprite, because the default sprite of unity somehow has a black edge, which annoy me a lot.
    Now, I need to have a proper restaurant room, some art for the floor tile (should be easyer I guess, and maybe some art rework, and definitely good adjustment of the value for all the food/stuff.
    For me, I have been playing non-stop slay the spire, which means I have completely finish the game with all 4 character, killing the final boss (the spire). So I guess my time for the game is done, but I think it's good time spent because I learn a lot of interesting rouge design tricks from that game.

    [30min]Not much, opened the unity editor since 10.15, but only able to work for half an hour (it's 11.42) now, because I kept procrasting soo much.
    It's Tet (lunar new year) holiday, so I was quite relaxed, and not in the mood of doing much. I also play a lot of video games (the true reason, lol), finish Yakuza Kiwami 1, finish watching the yakuza 0 story on youtube (it's an amazing story), and is starting Yakuza kiwami 2. Also, just downloaded Metro Exodus since it's on Xbox Game Pass pc and it's so cheap, like 1e/3 months, so I want to test the most demanding video game on my brand new pc. And somehow finally finish the true last boss of slay the spire, so yeah, mostly video game.
    I also got super drunk on new year eve and vomit like a lot, really terrible, but I have been dirnking since soon (like 1 330ml bottle beer on lunch, 0.5 beer at the bar, and then in the eveing, 4 guys of us drink one vodka and one wiskey, but only I was vomitting, yeah..)

    [2hr]Add a basic score system, ui to display said score and the player will have score added when the customer finish a meals (random from 20-40), just to test it. Next, will make a punishment system where if the customer waits to long, he will leave and player will lose score.
    Add a scrolling number effect to the score count, so that it goes up slowly, not instantly, so that it looks cools. Unity Mathf.Lerp is weird, took a while to figure out.

    [4hr]The button prompts thing works now, the game looks much more responsive already. Also some more refactor around the tween animator so we can use it for almost anything now. Small remap button so that [Y] now will pick up heavy item, instead of pressing both shoulder buttons.

    [1hr]Add xbox buttons for more beautiful prompts.
    I decided to chicken out of the gamedev meet-up. It's not like I have to be there and show up with anything, it's just a nice and relax evening to go there and talk with people, but I kind of too busy (it took like 40 mins from my home) and would took the whole evening, and well, since I have mom and wife, I don't really feel like hanging out and party-ing anyway.

    [3hr]The progress bar bug is fixed. Also add a new state to the dining table component now, so it looks kind of ok-ish. It's sunday today and Tuesday there is a small game-dev meet-up and I kind of want to have the game to a play-able state to see how it works. I will have roughly like 3 hours tomorrow to make the game play-able, which I don't think is enough. Let's see.
    Great news is that I have a new computer now, which is awesome. It's super quick, and unity compile code a lot faster now, which mean writing code and then live test in Unity feels a lot better now. Also, gaming on this beast feels good. PUBG max everything and stable 60fps, what a dream.
